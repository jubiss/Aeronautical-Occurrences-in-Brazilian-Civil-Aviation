# Aeronautical Occurrences in Brazilian Civil Aviation

This project is a data analysis and exploration of the Brazilian Civil Aviation dataset, which includes information about airships and their occurrences. The dataset was obtained from the open government data website and contains multiple columns, including aircraft code, occurrence code, registration, and flight origin.

## Process Used

The following steps were used to explore and analyze the dataset:

1. Data cleaning and preparation: The dataset was cleaned to remove any missing or incomplete values. The necessary columns were selected for analysis, and any duplicates were removed.

2. Exploratory data analysis: Various data visualization techniques were used to analyze the dataset, including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. The relationships between variables were explored, and any trends or patterns were identified.

3. Hypothesis testing: Based on the insights generated from the exploratory analysis, hypotheses were formulated and tested. The null and alternative hypotheses were stated, and statistical tests were performed to determine the significance of the results.

4. Conclusion and insights: Finally, the results of the analysis were presented, and conclusions and insights were drawn. Recommendations were made based on the findings to help improve the safety and efficiency of the Brazilian Civil Aviation industry.

## Hypotheses Raised

1. The weight of an airship has a significant impact on the number of fatalities in an occurrence.

2. The type of engine used in an airship affects the likelihood of an occurrence happening.

3. Airships with more seats are involved in more occurrences than those with fewer seats.

## Exploratory Analysis

The exploratory analysis revealed the following insights:

1. The majority of occurrences happen during the landing phase of a flight.

2. Occurrences are more likely to happen in certain regions of Brazil, such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

3. The number of fatalities in an occurrence is typically low, with most occurrences resulting in no fatalities.

## Conclusions and Insights Generated

Based on the analysis, the following conclusions and insights were generated:

1. Airships with a higher weight have a higher likelihood of being involved in an occurrence with fatalities.

2. The type of engine used in an airship does not have a significant impact on the likelihood of an occurrence happening.

3. Airships with more seats are involved in more occurrences than those with fewer seats, likely due to increased passenger traffic.

4. Recommendations for improving the safety and efficiency of the Brazilian Civil Aviation industry include implementing stricter weight regulations for airships and increasing surveillance in high-risk regions.
